# Introduction

Personal solutions for C++ Primer 5th edition exercises, basically cover the 95% exercise. Only some ambiguous and superfluous ones has been left. All the source codes and answers were put into the markdown file. For each chapter and its exercises, only use the actual knowledge and skill, so there won't be any advance abilities requirement for present code. Also, some header files and data could be found in the corresponding directory.

# Limitations

- Comments and answers(statement without code) are written by Chinese Simplified, so if you are unfamiliar with it, you may need to find some other solutions that fits your language.(Or see the [Recommendations](#recommendations))
- There won't be any instructions for the knowledge from book, if you puzzled, you should jump into the communities(like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)) to solve your problem, or just review the books.
- (Only for Chinese Coder)An official solution manual may could help solve your problem, [here](./src/C++_Primer_Workbook_5th_Ed.\(Chinese_Edition\).pdf) is a shared version from the Internet. If you think it really helps you, you could buy the e-book or paper book.
